# Orchis Portfolio: One-Page Design & Plan

**Author:** Roy Natsir
**Version:** 1.0 (Static UI)
**Status:** Planning Complete

---

### 1. The Main Goal

The idea is to build my portfolio on-chain. Instead of a normal CV that just lists skills, this project is a live record of what I can _actually do_. It's my 'proof of work' for recruiters and other devs in the Web3 space.

For this first phase, the plan is simple: get a solid, great-looking static site up and running. This will be the foundation for all the Web3 stuff later on.

### 2. What I've Built (The Static Site Checklist)

Here's what I've put together so far for the static version, covering the first three weeks of my roadmap.

- **Clean HTML:** The foundation is semantic and accessible.
- **A Proper Stylesheet:** I set up a modular SCSS system with a dark-first theme, consistent colors, and responsive fonts.
- **A Solid Layout:** Used Flexbox for components and CSS Grid for the main galleries.
- **Reusable Parts:** The skill and project cards are built as modular components.
- **A Bit of Polish:** Added subtle transitions and animations on hover.
- **A Future-proof Component:** Built a CSS-only loading spinner for later use.

### 3. The User Experience

A visitor lands, scrolls through the sections, and can interact with the different parts. The navigation works, and the footer links are there for anyone who wants to connect.

### 4. The Toolkit (Phase 1)

- **Code:** HTML and a modular SCSS setup.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub, using a feature-branch workflow.
- **Tooling:** VS Code, Live Sass Compiler, Prettier, and Stylelint.

### 5. The Vibe

The design is clean, modern, and dark-first. It should feel professional without being boring. I'm using a lot of whitespace, a clear grid for the main content, and a simple color palette with Orchis Purple as the main accent.

### 6. Wireframe & Next Steps

- **Wireframe:** A simple, low-fidelity wireframe outlining the main sections (Header, Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Footer) has been created and saved as `wireframe.png`. This serves as the visual blueprint for the layout.

- **Next Steps (Phase 2 & Beyond):**
  - **JavaScript:** The next major phase is to make this static site dynamic using Vanilla JavaScript.
  - **React & Next.js:** After that, the entire project will be migrated to a professional Next.js and TypeScript architecture.
  - **Smart Contracts:** Following the frontend migration, the core on-chain features (CV, NFT Cards) will be developed and integrated.
