# Day 29: Introduction to JavaScript & ES6

## Concepts Mastered

- **Execution Environment:** Successfully ran JS modules using the `Live Server` VS Code extension. Understood that `type="module"` is required in HTML.
- **Core ES6 Features:**
  - **Variables:** `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed.
  - **Template Literals:** Used `` `${}` `` for clean string creation.
  - **Arrow Functions:** Wrote concise functions with `=>`.
  - **Destructuring:** Extracted object properties directly into variables.
  - **Modules:** Used `export` in `utils.js` and `import` in `latihan.js` to share code.
- **Tooling Awareness:** Understood that ESLint removes unused imports, reinforcing the need to use all imported code.

## Key Takeaway

Modern JavaScript development is modular. Mastering the ES6 features covered today is the absolute minimum requirement for building any professional web application.
